# project_portofolio
Porto-folio project done for Udacity - first time trying Gitub, so this might go wrong :)

#**description**

-project done with Bootstraps

-html , css files go in separate folder

-img folder for all images

-uploaded pdf called p1 - this was the mockup that should inspire us

-should include 4 images, at least 1 `h1` and at least 1 `p`

-should be responsive


```.style-line {
    height: 30px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #0c2b88;
    border-width: 1px 0 0 0;
    border-radius: 20px;
    }

hr.style-line:before {
    display: block;
    content: "";
    height: 30px;
    margin-top: -31px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #0c2b88;

#BUGS

-does not render in my Internet Explorer (using Verion 8.0.7601.17514)
(EE does not work with Bootstraps or I need to upgrade my local EE? yet to figure out...)
